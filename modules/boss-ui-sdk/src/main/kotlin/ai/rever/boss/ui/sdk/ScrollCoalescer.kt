/**

 * between them however many frames were skipped, whereas dropping a delta destroys information that

/**
 * Turns a scroll container's per-frame offset stream into the handful of `ScrollEvent`s worth putting
 * on an IPC stream.
 *
 * `ui_protocol.proto` has carried `ScrollEvent` since the beginning and nothing ever raised one, for a
 * concrete reason: a fling emits one offset per frame, so wiring a scroll position straight to the wire
 * is one cross-process message every ~16ms for the duration of the gesture, per scrolling surface. That
 * is the throttling policy #34 deferred this family for.
 *
 * ## The policy
 *
 * At most one event per [WINDOW_MS], **and the resting position always arrives**. Those are two
 * requirements, and the second is the one that is easy to get wrong: the obvious throttle
 * (`Flow.sample`) samples on a timer and simply does not emit the tail of a burst, so a fling leaves
 * the plugin holding whatever offset happened to be current at the last tick — permanently wrong, with
 * no later event to correct it, because a scroll that has stopped produces nothing more.
 *
 * ## How it holds
 *
 * [conflate] plus a [delay] in the collector, rather than a timer:
 *
 * - conflation keeps the **newest** pending offset and discards the ones it superseded, which is
 *   exactly coalescing — and it cannot drop the last one, because the last one is by definition never
 *   superseded;
 * - the collector's `delay` is the window, and it is applied *after* emitting, so the first movement of
 *   a gesture goes out immediately instead of waiting a frame budget;
 * - upstream completion cannot outrun the collector: a conflated channel closes gracefully, so the
 *   buffered value is delivered before the flow ends.
 *
 * The result is an invariant a test can hold onto, and a stronger one than "the last event arrives":
 * **the emitted deltas sum to the total displacement**, always, whatever the burst shape. A plugin that
 * accumulates them is never out of step with what the user sees — it just learns about the middle of a
 * fling in fewer, larger steps.
 *
 * No timers, no shared mutable state across coroutines, and nothing to leak when the surface goes away:
 * the flow is cold and dies with its collector.
