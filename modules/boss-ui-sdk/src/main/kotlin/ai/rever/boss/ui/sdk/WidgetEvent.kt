 * A user interaction a renderer reports back to the plugin that owns the surface.

 * One variant per `UIEvent` oneof case in `ui_protocol.proto`, so the mapping to the wire
 * ([UIEventMapper]) is total and a renderer cannot express an event the protocol can't carry.
 * Renderers previously reported events as a `(nodeId, eventType: String, eventData: String)` triple,
 * which silently lost the fields that don't fit one string (a selection's index, a key's modifiers)
 * and made "did anyone map this case?" invisible to the compiler.
