/**
 * The directory roots a path from outside the host must resolve inside.
 *
 * The orchestrator receives filesystem paths over IPC — `ProcessManifest.sourceFiles` is
 * written by the process being diagnosed, not by the host — and hands the contents it reads
 * to [AiRepairClient], which posts them to a third-party model. Every such path is judged
 * here first, so that the set of files that can leave the machine is the host's decision.
 *
 * ### What "resolves inside" means
 *
 * A textual `startsWith` on the path a caller sent answers the wrong question: `..` walks up
 * out of the root, a symlink inside the root points anywhere, and `/tmp/project` is a string
 * prefix of the unrelated `/tmp/project-notes`. So [resolve]:
 *
 * - canonicalizes the **deepest existing ancestor** of the candidate (`toRealPath`), which
 *   resolves every symlink and `..` in the part of the path that exists, and re-appends the
 *   absent tail. A path that does not exist yet is still judged, on where it *would* land;
 * - refuses any tail component that exists, which is two cases in one: a **symlink with a
 *   missing target**, the one thing below the deepest resolvable ancestor that exists and can
 *   still name somewhere else entirely; and a `..` that climbs above that ancestor, because
 *   the parent of a directory that exists also exists. So a path that walks up out of the
 *   root is refused rather than compared;
 * - compares by path component ([Path.startsWith]), not by string prefix.
 *
 * ### The roots themselves
 *
 * [none] grants nothing, and so does a root that cannot be resolved to a directory — an
 * unusable root must narrow the reach rather than widen it. A filesystem root (`/`, `C:\`)
 * is also refused as a root, because confining to it confines nothing; a caller that passes
 * one gets a warning and no reach, not silent unlimited reach.
 *
 * ### What this is not
 *
 * Not a sandbox: anything inside a granted root is readable. It narrows what an IPC caller
 * can name to the directory the host meant, which for this module is the project root. It
 * also does not close the gap between the check and the read — the file is opened again by
 * path afterwards, and a component could change in between. Both are recorded rather than
 * claimed to be solved.
