#   run-webdriver.mjs   W3C WebDriver via geckodriver     (Firefox)
#   run-screenshot.mjs  CPU-idle detection + screencapture (Safari, Dia, Atlas)

# BOSS's built-in fluck browser is driven separately through the host's own MCP
# tools (browser_navigate / browser_run_js), so it is not launched here.
