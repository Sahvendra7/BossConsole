# Unit test for scripts/release-download-table.sh, which generates the Downloads
# section of every release body (release.yml) and of the curated notes
# (release-notes.yml) — markdown that also lands in app_releases.release_notes
# and is rendered by the in-app update dialog. Nothing else exercises it before
# it ships, because release workflows only run on publish.
#
# Guards, in order of what would hurt most:
#
#   * A row for an asset that was never published. Windows ARM64 and Linux ARM64
#     are optional builds, so a table that hardcodes nine rows produces live 404s
#     on any release where one failed.
#   * A pre-release page whose "always latest" links resolve to an older stable
#     build — a downgrade offered as an upgrade.
#   * A version string that is not a version reaching the URLs verbatim.
#   * Column count, because the update dialog renders this at 11.sp in a 480.dp
#     dialog and a fourth column wraps every cell.
#
