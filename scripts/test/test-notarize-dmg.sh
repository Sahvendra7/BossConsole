# Apple is faked by putting a stub `xcrun` on PATH, so the real code path runs:
# argument construction, output parsing, the submit-vs-wait decision, and the
# retry accounting. Each scenario's stub records what it was asked to do in
# $TD/calls (subcommands) and $TD/args (full argv), and the assertions read
# those — which is how the central regression is expressed: after a dropped
# poll, attempt 2 must be a `wait` on the existing submission, never a second
# `submit`.
