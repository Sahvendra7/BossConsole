# release-download-table.sh
#
# Emits the "Downloads" section of a release body as markdown: a table of this
# release's assets, followed by links that always resolve to the newest release.
#
# Two workflows publish release bodies and both need this section identical —
# release.yml writes the placeholder body, and release-notes.yml substitutes it
# into the curated notes. Generating it from one script is what keeps them from
# drifting apart, which is how the table ended up listing bare filenames with no
# links at all.
#
# Two things this must not do:
#
#   * Link an asset that was never published. Windows ARM64 and Linux ARM64 are
#     optional builds — create-release requires only macos-arm64, linux-amd64 and
#     windows (release.yml), and the copy steps say "tolerate missing" out loud.
#     A row that looks actionable and 404s is worse than no row, so pass
#     --assets/--asset-list and rows without a matching file are dropped (and
#     reported on stderr, never silently).
#
#   * Point a pre-release page at an older stable build. The edge function
#     excludes pre-releases unless asked, so without --prerelease the "always
#     latest" links on a 9.5.0-beta.1 page would resolve to 9.4.0 — a downgrade,
#     presented as though it were newer.
#
# The table stays at three columns on purpose: this markdown is also rendered by
# the in-app update dialog, inside a 480.dp dialog at 11.sp with equal-weight
# columns, where a fourth column wraps every cell.
#
# Usage:
#   release-download-table.sh --version <X.Y.Z> [options]
#
#     --version <v>      release version, without a leading "v" (required)
#     --repo <o/n>       repo whose release assets to link
#                        (default: risa-labs-inc/BossConsole-Releases;
#                        release.yml passes $GITHUB_REPOSITORY so that
#                        sync-release.yml's private->public rewrite applies)
#     --assets <dir>     only list assets present in this directory
#     --asset-list <f>   only list assets named in this file, one per line
#     --prerelease       this release is a pre-release
#
# Example:
#   release-download-table.sh --version 9.4.0 --assets ./release-assets
