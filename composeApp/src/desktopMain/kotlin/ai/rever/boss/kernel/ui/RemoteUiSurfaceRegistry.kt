/**
 * The host-side renderer of one remote surface, as the transport sees it.
 *
 * Implemented by `RemotePanelComponent` / `RemoteTabComponent`. Both callbacks arrive on whichever thread
 * gRPC delivered the message on, never the UI thread, and both are invoked **while the surface's publish
 * lock is held** — which is what makes the sequence a host observes monotonic. So an implementation must:
 *
 * - touch only thread-safe state (Compose snapshot state is — writing it from any thread is fine);
 * - not block, and not dispatch and wait; and
 * - never call back into [RemoteUiSurfaceRegistry] or its surface from inside the callback.
 *
 * Anything heavier belongs on the far side of a state write the UI observes.

 * component that never went away.
 *

 * plugin-side surfaces here, host-side renderers in [hosts] — and every delivery is a lookup at the
 * moment it happens. A tree that arrives with nobody attached is retained on the surface for whoever
 * attaches next; an event emitted with no plugin registered is reported undeliverable to its caller
 * rather than queued into a void or thrown; and a component that attaches to an already-streaming
 * surface is immediately given the current tree and connection state, so it does not render blank
