/**
 * `created` / `destroyed` for a remote surface — the half of the lifecycle family that can actually be
 * delivered, and nothing else.
 *
 * ## What the events mean
 *
 * **A surface's rendered lifetime**, not a plugin's. `created` says "a host renderer is attached and
 * your stream is live — your widgets are on screen"; `destroyed` says that stopped being true. That is
 * the thing a plugin cannot work out for itself and the thing it needs in order to start and stop
 * doing work; whereas "my process registered a surface" is something it already knows, having done it.
 *
 * The pairing is a **rendezvous between two independent lifetimes**, so it is announced by whichever
 * half completes it — the component attaching to a streaming surface, or a stream binding under an
 * already-attached component — and the latch below makes that exactly once either way. It re-arms on
 * teardown, so a plugin that crashes and respawns under a component that never went away is told
 * `created` again: the new process never heard the first one.
 *
 * ## Why `destroyed` is deliverable after all
 *
 * #34 deferred this family because "`destroyed` cannot be flushed: the outgoing flow dies with the
 * surface scope", and a create-without-destroy lifecycle is worse than none. That was true of a flush
 * *after* teardown. It is not true of an ordinary send *before* one: `RemoteUiSurface.close()` calls
 * `Channel.close()`, which is graceful — already-buffered elements are handed to the collector and
 * *then* the flow completes. So enqueueing `destroyed` and immediately closing delivers it, as the
 * last event the plugin sees, with no drain phase and no new API.
 *
 * Every teardown path that still has a transport therefore announces it: a host component detaching,
 * the plugin's own `UnregisterUI`, and kernel shutdown.
 *
 * ## The one path that cannot, and why that is not a hole
 *
 * A **dead stream** — `RemoteUiSurfaceRegistry.closeStream` after a plugin crashed or its channel
 * dropped. There is nothing to deliver over and nobody to receive it. Stream completion is the signal
 * there, exactly as #34 anticipated: the plugin's own event flow ending *is* the notice, and a process
 * that has died does not need one. So the guarantee this file offers is precise rather than absolute:
 * **a plugin that can be told, is told**.
 *
 * ## The limit of the pairing
 *
 * The latch pairs the two events **at enqueue**. Delivery is the outgoing channel's business, and that
 * channel sheds its **oldest** entry when a plugin stops reading (`RemoteUiSurface.OUTGOING_BUFFER`) —
 * and `created` is by construction the oldest thing a rendered surface ever queues. A plugin that stops
 * reading for long enough to shed its own first [RemoteUiSurface.OUTGOING_BUFFER] events can therefore
 * lose its `created` and later receive a `destroyed` on its own. Narrow, and self-announcing:
 * [RemoteUiSurface.shedEventCount] is non-zero exactly when it is possible. Documented rather than
 * engineered around, because the alternative is a second delivery path for two events per surface.
