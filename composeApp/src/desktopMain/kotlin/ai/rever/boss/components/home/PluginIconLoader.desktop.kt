 * Fetches and decodes plugin store icons. Shape follows `HighQualityFaviconService`.
 *
 * **What this does not defend against.** `icon_url` is operator-supplied data and redirects are
 * followed, so a store row (or a redirect off one) can make this client issue a GET at an address
 * of the row author's choosing, including one inside the network the app runs in. The scheme check
 * only covers the initial URL. Nothing is returned to the caller but a decoded image or null, so
 * this leaks reachability rather than content, and only an admin who can write store rows can
 * reach it - but a deployment that treats store rows as untrusted should pin an allowed host or
 * proxy these through the store instead.
