 * from a callback the host invoked, and the fix is to drop that plugin, not the
 * user's windows, tabs and terminal sessions.

 *    a plugin's to give back. Disabling the plugin frees nothing at the moment
 *    the heap is already exhausted, and every step of recovery (closing tabs,
 *    unloading, rendering a toast) allocates. The render path carves these out
 *    for the same reason; see `decideWindowExceptionRoute`.
 * 3. **No recovery wired** ([recoveryAvailable] false) — headless, or a crash
 *    before the plugin layer exists. Pretending we disabled something would
 *    leave the crashing plugin live and the dialog dismissed.
 * 4. Otherwise recoverable.
 *
 * Deliberately pure so the matrix is testable without a plugin manager, a
 * window, or a JVM willing to be exited.

 * and tear down tabs across every window on an already-exhausted heap, which is
