/**
 * Answers the home screen's two store questions: what could be installed, and install it.
 *
 * **The install leg is delegated, not reimplemented.** [installer] is the same
 * [StoreMissingDependencyInstaller] the missing-dependency prompt uses, and its `install` is
 * already generic in the plugin id. That matters more than it looks: AGENTS.md records five
 * separate defects found in review of that one method - downloading onto the final filename
 * truncates an existing jar the moment the connection opens, a surviving `.sig` sidecar
 * hard-fails the next load, a missing `installed.json` row makes the plugin impossible to
 * disable persistently, a store row can point at a jar declaring some other plugin, and a
 * promotion that half-succeeds leaves an unvetted jar at a scannable name. A second download
 * path here would have to get all five right again.
 *
 * @param repository the remote store, null when it never initialised (offline first run, or
 *   absent store credentials) - discovery is then simply empty
 * @param installer the shared store installer, reached through its interface so this class does
 *   not also own how a jar lands on disk
