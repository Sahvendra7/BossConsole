/**
 * Uninstalls a plugin whose job another plugin has taken over.
 *
 * A retired plugin cannot uninstall itself, and leaving it installed means the user keeps a
 * panel that no longer does anything. The store listing can be unlisted so nobody *new*
 * installs it, but that does nothing for the machines that already have it - which is every
 * machine, when the retired plugin was a first-run default.
 *
 * The sweep runs once per launch, before any plugin is loaded, so a retired plugin never
 * registers a panel or an MCP tool on a machine where its replacement is present. No
 * "already done" flag is needed: the sweep keys on the plugin being installed, and removing
 * it is what makes the next launch a no-op.
