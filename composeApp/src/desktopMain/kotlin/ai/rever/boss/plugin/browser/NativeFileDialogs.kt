/**
 * Native macOS file panels for the page's own file dialogs.
 *
 * JxBrowser does not leave `<input type="file">` unanswered: both the Compose and the Swing
 * `BrowserView` install a set of *default* callbacks when they are created, and every one of
 * them shows a `javax.swing.JFileChooser`. On macOS that renders through `AquaFileChooserUI` -
 * a Swing re-creation of the pre-10.7 Open panel, with a "Where:" popup and a "File Format:"
 * combo - so uploading a file from BOSS looked a decade older than doing it from Safari or
 * Chrome, which both open the real `NSOpenPanel` (sidebar, column view, search, Recents).
 *
 * `java.awt.FileDialog` *is* that panel: its macOS peer (`sun.lwawt.macosx.CFileDialog`) is a
 * thin wrapper over `NSOpenPanel`/`NSSavePanel`. So the fix is not to restyle anything, it is
 * to answer these callbacks ourselves before JxBrowser installs its own.
 *
 * **Registration has to happen before the view is created.** `DefaultCallbacks.register()`
 * checks `advisable.get(type).isPresent()` and *skips* any callback already set, so setting
 * ours first wins and JxBrowser never installs the Swing chooser. [installOn] is therefore
 * called from browser construction, not from composition - and because the view's matching
 * `unregister()` only removes what it actually registered, ours survives a view being
 * detached and re-attached (tab switch, fullscreen, a popup adopted into a window).
 *
 * **macOS only, deliberately.** `FileDialog` is the wrong trade on the other two:
 * - **Windows**: `setFilenameFilter` is documented as a no-op there (the Win32 peer drives
 *   `GetOpenFileName` with filter *strings*, not a per-item Java callback), so an
 *   `accept=".png"` input would silently list every file; and `FileDialog` cannot select a
 *   directory at all, so `webkitdirectory` would hand Chromium a *file* path and quietly
 *   yield nothing. The `JFileChooser` default gets both right. A native Windows panel is
 *   worth having, but it needs the Win32 filter strings and a folder browser, not this.
 * - **Linux**: AWT resolves to `GtkFileDialogPeer` only when GTK loads, and otherwise falls
 *   back to `XFileDialogPeer`, a Motif-era dialog worse than the chooser it would replace.
 *
 * **What is not covered**: the auth browsers (`DesktopPasskeyBrowserView`,
 * `DesktopAuthBrandSite`) build their own `newBrowser()` and never call [installOn], so they
 * keep the Swing chooser. That is fine for a sign-in page with no upload field, and stated
 * here so the next reader does not have to infer it.
