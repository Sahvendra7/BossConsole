/**
 * Asks the PAGE whether it wants to own the find shortcut, so a site with its own
 * find-in-page (Google Sheets, Docs, Notion) keeps it instead of being overridden.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * JxBrowser's key hook gives us exactly two answers — `PressKeyCallback.Response.proceed()`
 * and `.suppress()` — and no way to learn whether the page did anything with a key it was
 * given. There is no API for this in 9.4.0; the search package is `TextFinder` plus
 * `FindOptions`/`FindResult` and nothing else. So the page has to tell us.
 *
 * Chrome answers the same question the same way. Ctrl/Cmd+F is a *non-reserved* accelerator
 * there: the page sees the key first, and if it calls `preventDefault()` Chrome skips its own
 * find bar. That is the entire mechanism behind Sheets' find working in Chrome, and matching
 * it means we inherit every site that already knows how to opt in — no allowlist to maintain.
 *
 * ## How the verdict is read
 *
 * One capture-phase `keydown` listener on `window`. Capture on `window` is the FIRST thing in
 * the dispatch path, and this is injected at document start, so it runs before any handler the
 * page registers.
 *
 * The verdict is read from a `setTimeout(…, 0)` rather than from the listener body, and that
 * deferral is load-bearing twice over:
 *
 *  - `defaultPrevented` is only final once dispatch has finished. Read inline, in the first
 *    listener to run, it is always false.
 *  - It survives `stopPropagation()`. The obvious alternative — a second listener at the
 *    bubble phase on `window`, reading the flag there — never fires when a page stops
 *    propagation partway, which is precisely what Sheets and Docs do. The timeout is queued
 *    from the capture phase, so nothing the page does downstream can cancel it.
 *
 * ## What a page can do with this
 *
 * Nothing it could not already do. The only lever is "suppress BOSS's find bar on my own
 * page", and calling `preventDefault()` on the key already achieves exactly that — which is
 * the sanctioned way to ask. A page spamming [BrowserFindKeyProbeBridge.report] gains no new
 * capability, and the bridge drops a report with no decision waiting on it, so the loop is
 * cheap to serve.

     *
     * `event.code` is the physical key, which is what an accelerator is defined against — a
     * Dvorak or AZERTY layout puts a different character on that key, and Chromium fires the
     * accelerator on the position either way. `keyCode` is the fallback purely for a frame
     * whose engine predates `code`; both are checked rather than one, because getting this
     * wrong fails SILENTLY (no report, so the deadline elapses and our bar opens over the
     * page's own).
