/**
 * Shared owner of a browser's single `InjectJsCallback` slot.
 *
 * JxBrowser allows exactly ONE `InjectJsCallback` per [Browser]; a second
 * `browser.set(InjectJsCallback…)` silently replaces the first. More than one feature
 * can want document-start injection (e.g. the co-browse rrweb recorder on the
 * `feat/cobrowse-tab-sharing` branch), so calling `browser.set` directly makes
 * whichever registers second clobber the other.
 *
 * This dispatcher claims the slot once per browser and fans each document-start event
 * out to every registered injector. **Every** document-start injector must go through
 * [register] instead of setting the callback directly, or the clobber returns.
 *
 * Three injectors register today: [FluckEngine]'s find-key probe (every frame),
 * [BrowserHandleImpl]'s co-browse recorder, and its page-event script. That is not a
 * hypothetical list - it is why `InjectJsCallbackOwnershipTest` exists. The co-browse
 * recorder used to call `browser.set` directly, and since the find-key probe registers
 * here when the browser is created, **starting a tab share replaced the dispatcher's
 * callback and silently stopped the find-chord probe being injected for the rest of that
 * tab's life.** No error, no log line; Cmd+F simply stopped noticing that a page wanted
 * to serve its own find bar.
 *
 * An injector switches itself off by making its own body inert (each one checks the state
 * it depends on), never by removing the callback - that would take the slot away from the
 * others.

     * enough - the callback that remains has nothing left to fan out to, and the browser is closing.
