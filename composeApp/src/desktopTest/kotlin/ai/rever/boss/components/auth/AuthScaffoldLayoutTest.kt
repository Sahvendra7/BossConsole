/**
 * Layout guarantees for [AuthScaffold], the frame every authentication screen sits in.
 *
 * The bug these exist for: the old `AuthCard` declared `.fillMaxWidth().widthIn(max = 400.dp)`, which
 * looks like a 400dp cap and is not one. `fillMaxWidth` measures its child with
 * `minWidth == maxWidth == the parent's width`, and `widthIn` enforces incoming constraints, so the
 * cap was coerced straight back up and the card spanned the whole window. Nothing in review catches
 * that - the intent is written right there in the source - and nothing catches it on a small window
 * either, because at 400dp wide the broken and the fixed layout are identical. It needs a measurement.
 *
 * The window is reproduced with `clipToBounds()`, following [ai.rever.boss.crash.CrashReportDialogLayoutTest]:
 * without clipping, content wider than the window is merely painted outside it and every assertion
 * about visibility still passes.
 *
 * A plain `Text` stands in for a screen's fields, so no `LoginViewModel` - and therefore no auth
 * service, no network - is dragged into a layout test, and no test tag has to be added to production
 * code to make it measurable.
