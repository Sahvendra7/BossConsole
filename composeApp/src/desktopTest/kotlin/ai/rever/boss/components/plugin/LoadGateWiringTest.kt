/**
 * That the recovery path is actually connected end to end.
 *
 * A **source** test, and it proves less than a behavioural one. It exists for the four joins a unit
 * test cannot reach: a composable mounted in a window's dialog host, an `actual` bridge that talks
 * to `PluginStoreSetup`, a startup registration in `main`, and a catch block inside the plugin
 * manager's load lock. The decisions themselves are tested properly in
 * [VersionGateTranslationTest], [PluginLoadRemedyLabelTest] and [PluginRollbackStoreTest].
 *
 * Each join was a silent failure on its own: without the snapshot there is nothing to revert to,
 * without the record no dialog appears, without the registration the dialog has no remedies, and
 * without the mount none of it is on screen. All four together are what turns one ERROR line in
 * `~/.boss/logs` into a button.
