/**
 * The guard for the defect this rewrite exists to remove.
 *
 * The home screen had two mount points and took twelve action callbacks, so each mount had to
 * supply all twelve. One of them - `DashboardContentProviderImpl`, the browser's about:blank
 * surface - passed eleven of them as `{ /* No-op for browser plugin */ }` and `onShowSettings` as
 * null. Every project card, file card, split template, "Open File", "New Project", "New Tab",
 * "New Terminal", "New Window", "Open Project" and "Settings" rendered normally there and did
 * nothing at all. Two more, `onActivatePlugin` and `onNewTerminal`, were dead on both ends: the
 * screen never invoked them and one call site had wired `onActivatePlugin` to a bare `logger.debug`.
 *
 * Nothing failed. There was no test, no log line and no visible difference between a card that
 * worked and a card that did not.
 *
 * `HomeScreen` therefore takes **no action callbacks at all**: it emits on [DashboardEventBus],
 * whose handlers live in `BossAppEventBusEffects` and are window-filtered. These tests hold that
 * shape in place structurally, because the failure mode is silence and a behavioural test of "did
 * clicking this do something" is exactly what nobody wrote for four years.
