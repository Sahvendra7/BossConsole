/**
 * Pins that the host's actions stay ON SCREEN at the narrowest the vertical tab bar goes.
 *
 * The bar is user-resizable down to [TabBarVerticalWidthRange].start, 120dp. Four 32dp buttons
 * with 4dp between them and 8dp either side need 156dp; three need exactly 120, with no margin.
 *
 * A `Row` does not wrap. Measured at 120dp, what it actually did was hand the last child ZERO
 * width - Search came back as `Rect(0, 0, 0, 0)` while the other three kept their full 32dp - so
 * Search simply was not there, on a width the user can reach by dragging.
 *
 * That measured shape is why these assertions check each icon's SIZE and not just that it sits
 * between the bar's edges: a zero-width rect at the origin is inside every bounds check that will
 * ever be written, so the first version of this test passed against the very bug it was added for.
 *
 * Nothing else would have caught it either: every placement test here is on the pure function,
 * which answers "the bar has a foot" perfectly well while the foot is too narrow to show what is
 * in it.
