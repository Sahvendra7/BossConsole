/**
 * Pins the precedence between the three renderings of Settings / Search / Sign Out.
 *
 * The order is rail, then the tab bar's footer, then the floating cluster, and each step is a
 * choice rather than an accident. The floating cluster is a native always-on-top window with no
 * click-through, so it is the most intrusive of the three and goes last; the rail was already
 * preferred over it and stays preferred; the tab bar's foot is chrome the app draws anyway.
 *
 * Getting this backwards does not crash - it puts a dead click region over the content area in a
 * window that had a perfectly good place to put four icons.
