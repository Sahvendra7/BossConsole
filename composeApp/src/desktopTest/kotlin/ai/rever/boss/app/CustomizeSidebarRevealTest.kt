/**
 * Pins [withCustomizeTargetRevealed], the second half of the "View - Customize Sidebar..." repair.
 *
 * The first half - `reveal.showLeftSidebar = true` - predates this feature and was enough while
 * focus mode was the only thing that could hide a strip. It is not any more: the scaffold now
 * requires the preference AND the reveal flag to agree, so a strip switched off in settings would
 * swallow the menu item exactly the way focus mode used to, and the existing force-reveal would
 * quietly do nothing. That regression is invisible to every other test here, and the effect it
 * lives in cannot be exercised directly, which is why the decision is a pure function.
