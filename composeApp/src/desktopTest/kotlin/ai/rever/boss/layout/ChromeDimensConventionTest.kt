/**
 * Keeps the chrome bars reading [ChromeDimens] instead of literals.
 *
 * `ChromeMetricsTest` pins the arithmetic *given* a [ChromeDimens]. Nothing in it pins that the
 * chrome actually drawn and the metrics measured are the same thing, and the system fails open in
 * the direction that matters: a bar written next month as `HorizontalBar(height = 36.dp)` compiles,
 * ships, and is silently missing from the budget. That is the exact failure issue #239 opens with,
 * "a bar could be added or grown without anyone noticing".
 *
 * So this scans for it. `HorizontalBar` and `VerticalBar` are the only two ways a window chrome bar's
 * extent gets set, which makes them a small enough surface to police textually.
 *
 * A convention test in the style of `NoRawDialogConventionTest` and `SettingsSearchIndexDriftTest`,
 * and heuristic for the same reason: it cannot parse Kotlin. It reads the argument that follows the
 * call, on the same line or the next few, which is how every call site in the tree is written.
