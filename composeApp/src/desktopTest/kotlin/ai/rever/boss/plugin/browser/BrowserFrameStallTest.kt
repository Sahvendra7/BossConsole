/**
 * Guards the pure decisions in [BrowserFrameStall] - the ones that decide whether a user's browser
 * view gets yanked out of composition and put back.
 *
 * Both fail in the same direction when got wrong: re-attaching too often, which is a visible
 * flicker on pages that were never broken.
 *
 * **What this does not cover**, so green here is not mistaken for a verified mechanism: the
 * supersede-per-redirect logic, the visibility gate, the cap and cooldown, and the re-attach
 * itself all need a live JxBrowser view and are covered only by the manual run recorded in the PR
 * (same click path: 0/5 painted before, 5/5 after, watchdog firing only on the AI Mode commits).
