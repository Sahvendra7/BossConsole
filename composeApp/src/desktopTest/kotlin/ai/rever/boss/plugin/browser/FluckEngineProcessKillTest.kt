/**
 * Guards the force-kill half of [FluckEngine.recycleWedgedEngine] against the two ways it
 * silently did nothing in production.
 *
 * A wedged engine's Chromium tree outlived every recycle: its `close()` failed fast on dead IPC
 * (so a timeout-only test read it as success), and the generic sweeper skips anything parented to
 * this process, which every engine we spawn is. The tree kept the profile lock - sending the
 * replacement engine to a throwaway temp profile, which signs the user out of every site - and
 * kept its audio helper playing the video from a tab that had already been closed.
 *
 * Real processes rather than mocks, because both failures were about what the OS does, not about
 * what the code believes: a helper that has been reparented cannot be found from its old parent,
 * and SIGTERM is a request a stopped or wedged process is free to ignore.
