/**
 * Covers when a retired plugin is uninstalled and, mostly, when it is not.
 *
 * Every "not" here is a case where removing it would take away the only panel the user has for
 * the job: the replacement missing, the replacement's jar gone, or a replacement too old to have
 * absorbed the retired plugin's work. The decision therefore fails closed at every step, which
 * is the opposite of `satisfiesVersionFloor`'s own default, so it needs pinning rather than
 * trusting.
