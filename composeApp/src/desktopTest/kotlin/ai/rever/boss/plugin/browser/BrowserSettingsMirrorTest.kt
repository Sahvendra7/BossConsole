/**
 * The four browser settings that only exist as system properties.
 *
 * fluck-browser renders the toolbar and owns credential fill, and it loads in a separate
 * classloader that cannot see [BrowserSettings]. The mirror is the whole mechanism: without it the
 * Settings toggle flips a field nothing reads, which is a switch that appears to work and does
 * nothing. That has happened once already - `discretePasswordFill` was orphaned by the fill moving
 * out of the host.
 *
 * Two properties of the mirror are worth pinning, and they fail differently:
 *
 * - **A setter publishes.** Miss it and the toggle is dead.
 * - **The defaults are published up front.** A Kotlin property initializer does NOT run through the
 *   custom setter, so without the `init` block the property is simply absent until the settings
 *   file loads - and on a first launch, or after a failed load, it never does. That matters most
 *   for the two that default to ON, because a plugin reading an absent property has to guess which
 *   way an unset value falls.
 *
 * PROCESS-GLOBAL: [BrowserSettings] is a singleton for the whole test JVM and these properties are
 * real system properties, so [restore] puts back what it changed. Correct today because desktopTest
 * runs one class at a time.

     * field initialization, before `BrowserSettings` has necessarily initialized, so it captured
     * four nulls - and restoring nulls *cleared* the published defaults. The object initializes
     * once per JVM, so nothing republished them and every later test in the class saw an unset
     * property. Restoring through the setters is exact, because the setters are the only thing that
