/**
 * One owner for the browser's single document-start slot.
 *
 * JxBrowser allows exactly ONE `InjectJsCallback` per `Browser`, and a second
 * `set` of one **silently replaces the first** - no error, no log line, the displaced feature simply
 * stops happening. [BrowserInjectDispatcher] exists to own that slot and fan out to every
 * registered injector, and its KDoc says every injector must go through it.
 *
 * That instruction was not enough on its own. `startCoBrowseCapture` claimed the slot directly
 * anyway, and stayed the only claimant for long enough that nothing noticed. The moment
 * `setPageEventScript` arrived as a second one, sharing a tab would have switched off credential
 * capture in it (or been switched off by it, depending on which registered last).
 *
 * So this is a source check rather than a behaviour one, on purpose: the failure mode is a *second
 * call site*, and by the time a behaviour test could observe it, both features are already wired to
 * a real Chromium. Reading the source catches it at the moment it is written.
 *
 * If a genuinely new owner is ever wanted, this test is the place to argue with - do not simply
 * add a name to the allowlist.
