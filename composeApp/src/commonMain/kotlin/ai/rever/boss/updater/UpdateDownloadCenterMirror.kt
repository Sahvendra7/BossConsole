/**
 * Publishes the application's own update into [DownloadCenter], so it shares the
 * bottom-bar progress item and the dialog with every plugin transfer.
 *
 * A mirror rather than a second source: [UpdateManager.updateState] stays the one
 * place the update's progress lives (the top banner reads the same flow), and this
 * translates it. Two states writing the same row from different places is how a
 * banner and a bar come to disagree about whether an install has started.
 *
 * The row carries the actions the state allows, and only those:
 *
 * | State | Row |
 * |---|---|
 * | `Downloading` | progress, Cancel |
 * | `ReadyToInstall` | Install, Cancel (discards the staged file) |
 * | `Installing` | no actions - file moves and an elevated helper, past abandoning |
 * | anything else | no row |
