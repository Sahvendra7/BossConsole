/**
 * The project and workspace pickers, at the foot of the vertical tab bar.
 *
 * These live in the top bar. With the top bar switched off there is nowhere else for them, and
 * "which project am I in" stops being answerable from the window at all - so the vertical bar,
 * the one piece of window chrome still on screen in that configuration, takes them.
 *
 * Drawn ONLY when the top bar is off. Both at once would be the same two controls twice, and the
 * top bar is where they belong when it is there.
 *
 * They sit above the split map rather than below it. The map is the bar's last row by design -
 * it is a picture of the window, and a picture of the window belongs at the bottom of the thing
 * that lists what is in it.
