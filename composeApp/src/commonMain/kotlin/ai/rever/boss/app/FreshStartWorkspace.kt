/**
 * Whether a window that restored nothing should apply [workspace] as its starting layout.
 *
 * Two conditions, and both are load-bearing:
 * - **No project selected.** With a project, the reactive apply in
 *   `BossAppStartupEffects` already owns this and would apply the same workspace a
 *   second time.
 * - **The workspace can stand without one.** `{projectPath}` silently falls back to the
 *   user's home directory, so applying the Claude Code default here would open a
 *   terminal running `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` in `~` on the first launch
 *   of a fresh install. Browser-only needs nothing, which is why the Windows default
 *   reaches first launch and the terminal-first defaults keep waiting for a project,
 *   on every platform, exactly as before.
