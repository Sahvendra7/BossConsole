/**
 * Where BOSS works when no project is selected.
 *
 * Everything that needed a directory and had no project used to reach for
 * `System.getProperty("user.home")`: the `{projectPath}` placeholder in workspaces and split
 * templates, and every terminal opened before a project is picked (a null working directory
 * lands the shell in `~`). On macOS that is the worst available default - the first `ls`, or
 * any agent started in `~`, walks into `~/Desktop`, `~/Documents` and `~/Downloads`, and TCC
 * puts a permission prompt in front of the user for each one, for a directory they never
 * asked BOSS to open.
 *
 * `~/BossProjects` is the directory BOSS already owns: [ProjectCreationService] creates
 * projects there by default and the clone dialog clones there. Nothing macOS guards lives
 * inside it, so starting there asks for nothing.
 *
 * This does **not** select a project. "No Project" stays "No Project" - what changes is only
 * which directory the no-project case resolves to.

     * For callers that only need the string to compare against - [persisted], through
     * `WorkspaceExtractor`. Two reasons they must not use [ensureDefaultDirectory] instead:
     *
     * - **Cost and position.** Extraction runs from the auto-save `snapshotFlow`, whose
     *   producer re-runs on the composition thread whenever any tab's title, url or working
     *   directory changes, and from the Last Session teardown, which can be the shutdown-hook
     *   thread. A `createDirectories` syscall per browser-title update is the kind of blocking
     *   I/O `docs/THREADING.md` rules out, and its warn-on-failure would repeat just as often.
     * - **Stability.** [ensureDefaultDirectory] answers with the *home* directory when creation fails. A
     *   transient failure at extract time would make [persisted] compare a terminal's real
     *   `~/BossProjects` against `~`, find them different, and freeze the resolved default
     *   into the saved layout - precisely what [persisted] exists to prevent. This cannot
     *   fail, so *that* direction is closed: which string the comparison uses no longer
     *   depends on filesystem state at extract time.
     *
     * The mirror case is not closed *here*, and does not need to be: if creation failed when
     * the *terminal* was created, its working directory is the home directory, which differs
     * from this and so is persisted verbatim. [restored] then reads that `~` as absent on the
     * way back in, so the layout self-heals on the next restore rather than carrying the
     * fallback forever.
     *
     * Through `File` on both sides, so the separator normalization matches what [resolve]
     * handed the tab.

     * second case loses the user's choice. Accepted rather than fixed - telling the two apart

     * were written by the code this replaces: a no-project terminal resolved to `~`, carried a
     * *non-null* `~`, and `WorkspaceExtractor` persisted it verbatim. So Last Session would go
     * on restoring terminals into the home directory after the upgrade - and [persisted] would

     * prompts would return on the first restore and never stop, for exactly the people this

     * auto-save then extracts that, [persisted] nulls it, and the layout is repaired. It is a
     * migration by value rather than a versioned one, because `TabConfig` carries no version
     * and adding one to fix this would be a workspace format change.

     * The cost is a terminal someone deliberately parked in their home directory, which

     * `addTerminalTab(workingDirectory = <home>)` and had that layout saved is relocated by the
     * same rule. So this is not *only* a migration, though that is what it is for.
     *
     * Best effort, and exact-match by design: a stored path differing by a trailing separator,
     * or a home reached through a symlink (`/Users/x` against a resolved
     * `/System/Volumes/Data/Users/x`), is not recognised and goes on restoring into `~`.
     * Canonicalising would put filesystem I/O on the restore path for every terminal tab.
