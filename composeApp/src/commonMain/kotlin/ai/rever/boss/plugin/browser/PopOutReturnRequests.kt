/**
 * Carries "put me back on this tab" from a detached pop-out to the window that owns the tab.
 *
 * The pop-out's Back-to-tab button lives in `BrowserHandleImpl`, which can raise a window but
 * cannot select a tab: selecting one is `SplitViewState`'s, and the tab itself belongs to the
 * browser **plugin**, whose component type the host cannot even name. The obvious fix - a new
 * callback on `BrowserHandle` for the plugin to register - would work, and costs an api release,
 * a host version pin and a plugin release before anybody sees it, plus a permanent branch for
 * hosts and plugins that predate it.
 *
 * None of that is needed, because the plugin already tells the host its tab id when it registers
 * the fullscreen handler. So the request travels in-process instead: the handle emits, and the
 * window that owns that tab resolves the panel and selects it.
 *
 * A `SharedFlow` rather than a `StateFlow`: this is an event, and two presses of the same button
 * must both arrive rather than the second being swallowed as a duplicate value. Buffered and
 * emitted with `tryEmit` so a press can never suspend the UI thread that raised it, and scoped by
 * window so that with two windows open only the one holding the tab acts.
