/**
 * Names which Supabase client a library log line came from, and routes it through BossLogger.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. supabase-kt writes its own diagnostics with a fixed `(Supabase-Realtime)` tag
 * and nothing identifying the client. This app runs THREE Supabase clients against the same
 * project - the main one in SupabaseConfig, the app-update watcher and the plugin-store watcher -
 * and an installed plugin may run more (the Toolbox does). So a line like
 *
 *     Warn: (Supabase-Realtime) Heartbeat timeout. Trying to reconnect in 7s
 *
 * says a socket is flapping without saying whose. With several clients the lines interleave, so
 * even the timing is unattributable: pairing a "Connected" with the next "Heartbeat timeout"
 * assumes both came from one client, and that assumption is how an investigation into exactly this
 * message spent its time on the wrong component before proving otherwise.
 *
 * It also stops these lines bypassing BossLogger. They went straight to stdout, so they carried no
 * category, were not in our format, and never reached a log file.
 *
 * [name] is the client's ROLE rather than its class: what a reader needs from a flapping socket is
 * which feature is affected.
