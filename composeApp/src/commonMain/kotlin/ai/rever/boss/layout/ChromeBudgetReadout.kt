 * This is a log line rather than a status-bar item on purpose: the configuration most worth

 * cannot report that. A visible readout belongs next to the density control in Settings, which is
 * reachable whatever the chrome is doing - that arrives with the density setting itself.
 *
 * [dimens] is a parameter rather than a `BossChrome.dimens` read inside this function, for the same
 * reason [ChromeMetrics.mainPanelBudget] refuses a default for it. Resolving it here would silently
 * report `Comfortable` if a provider were ever installed *between* this call and the bars, which is
 * the natural place to put one; taking it as an argument makes the caller name it from the same
