    /**
     * Chrome around a browser tab in the main panel, in its steady state.
     *
     * "Steady state" means no hover-reveal: a bar that focus mode is clearing counts as absent even
     * though sweeping the window edge brings it back temporarily. That is the honest number for
     * "how much room does the page get while I am reading it".
     *
     * [osName] and [isFullscreen] are only consulted for the macOS traffic-light reservation, which
     * is the one piece of vertical chrome that depends on the platform rather than on a preference.
     * Neither is defaulted, for the same reason [dimens] is not: a caller that guessed wrong about
     * the platform would get a plausible number with nothing to catch it.
     *
     * Deliberately **excludes**:
     * - `BossPanelTopBar` (`panelTopBarHeight`) - that is a `SidePanel` header. A browser tab in the
     *   main panel never pays it, and counting it here overstated the cost of the main panel by
     *   28dp in the first draft of issue #239. Do not add it back.
     * - `UpdateBanner` - present only when an update is waiting, and deliberately drawn even in
     *   focus mode. Transient, so it does not belong in a steady-state budget.
     * - Split view. Each additional panel adds its own tab bar and its own border ring; this
     *   measures a single panel, which is the best case, so a real split is never *better* than
     *   this number says.
     *
     * [dimens] has no default on purpose. Once density is user-selectable, a defaulted
     * `Comfortable` would mean "silently assume the user picked comfortable", and a caller that
     * forgot the argument would get a plausible wrong answer with nothing to catch it.
