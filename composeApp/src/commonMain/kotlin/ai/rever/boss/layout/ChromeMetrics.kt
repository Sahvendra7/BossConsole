     * "how much room does the page get while I am reading it".
     *
     * Deliberately **excludes**:
     * - `BossPanelTopBar` (`panelTopBarHeight`) — that is a `SidePanel` header. A browser tab in the
     *   main panel never pays it, and counting it here overstated the cost of the main panel by
     *   28dp in the first draft of issue #239. Do not add it back.
     * - `UpdateBanner` — present only when an update is waiting, and deliberately drawn even in
     *   focus mode. Transient, so it does not belong in a steady-state budget.
     * - Split view. Each additional panel adds its own tab bar; this measures a single panel, which
     *   is the best case, so a real split is never *better* than this number says.
