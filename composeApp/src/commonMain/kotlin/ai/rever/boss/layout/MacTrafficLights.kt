 *
 * So the clearance goes on whatever is actually under that box, and which chrome that is depends
 * on what is switched on. Two cases were missed on the first attempt and both were visible:
 *
 * - The **top bar** spans the full width at y=0, so when it is on it is what the lights land on -
 *   no column is. Its leftmost control sat under the green button.
 * - The lights are **wider than one column**. An icon strip is 40dp, so a 78dp box covers the
 *   whole strip and another 38dp of whatever is beside it - which is the vertical tab bar. Insetting
 *   only the strip left the second half of the box over the bar's Favorites header.
