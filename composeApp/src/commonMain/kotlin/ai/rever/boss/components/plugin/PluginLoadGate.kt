/**
 * A plugin the host refused to load because of a version floor, and what would actually fix it.
 *
 * **Why this exists.** `DynamicPluginLoader` refuses a plugin whose `minBossVersion` or
 * `minApiVersion` exceeds what this build provides, which is correct - running it would fail at some
 * arbitrary call site instead. But the refusal only reached an ERROR line in the log, so from the
 * user's side a plugin simply stopped existing. That is bad for any plugin and worse for a
 * `systemPlugin`: fluck-browser is the browser tab, so the observable symptom of a version floor was
 * "my browser is gone", with the reason available only to someone reading `~/.boss/logs`.
 *
 * It happened for real. fluck-browser 1.2.22 shipped requiring BOSS 9.4.23 while 9.4.22 was the
 * current release, and every host that took the plugin update lost its browser tab:
 *
 * ```
 * PluginBossVersionException: Plugin requires BOSS version 9.4.23 or later,
 *                             but current version is 9.4.22
 * ```
 *
 * Recovering meant knowing that the jar had been overwritten in place, finding the previous release,
 * and putting it back by hand. None of that is reasonable to expect, and all of it is knowable from
 * the exception the loader already throws.
 *
 * This models the refusal and the ways out. It is deliberately pure - no store, no updater, no
 * files - so the question "what should we offer the user" is answerable in a test.
 */

/**
 * Why the host refused the plugin.
 *
 * `required` and `current` live on the VERSION variants rather than up here: not every refusal is
 * a version comparison. [SignatureRejected] has no pair of numbers to report, and giving it two
 * would mean inventing values for a dialog to print.
