 * path - the one screen a user cannot get past - so a blank pane was likeliest exactly when the
 * network was bad and someone was trying to sign in. It also meant a live, fully interactive page with
 * no browser chrome: one stray click navigated the panel away with no way back until relaunch. The
 * bundled copy has neither problem and cannot change under the app.
 *
 * It is three sections of the real site, using the site's own markup classes, copy and stylesheet -
 * see the comment at the top of `index.html` for exactly what was trimmed and the one deliberate
 * difference (no webfont fetch, so mono falls back to the platform's).

 * Whether the brand panel should show [AUTH_BRAND_PAGE] over the drawn art. **On by default.**
 *
 * It was opt-in while the panel loaded the live site, and bundling the page is what earned the default:
 * the two real objections were a network fetch on the sign-in path - the one screen a user cannot get
 * past - and a live interactive page with no browser chrome. Neither survives a local file.
 *
 * What remains is that rendering it starts a Chromium engine, which is why there is still a way to turn
 * it off: `BOSS_AUTH_BRAND_SITE=false` (or `-Dboss.auth.brand.site=false`). A deployment that does not
 * want an engine on its login screen sets that and gets `AuthBrandArt`, which is a complete panel.
 *
 * The art stays composed underneath regardless, so a disabled flag, an engine that will not start and a
 * page that fails to render all land on the same drawn panel rather than on nothing.
