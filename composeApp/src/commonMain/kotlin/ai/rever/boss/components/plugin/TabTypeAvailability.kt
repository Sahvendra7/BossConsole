/**
 * Makes sure the plugin that renders a tab type is running before something tries
 * to open one, and offers to fix it when it is not.
 *
 * **The behaviour this replaces.** `BossMainWindowPanel.addTab` logs "Dropped tab
 * - no factory registered for its type" and returns -1. Every caller ignored that
 * return value, so with the browser plugin absent the OS could hand BOSS a link
 * and *nothing at all* appeared - no tab, no error, no dialog. The user's report
 * was "BOSS is my default browser and clicking a link does nothing", which is
 * exactly what it looks like from outside.
 *
 * The wait matters as much as the prompt. At a cold start the plugins have not
 * registered yet - `WorkspaceApplier.awaitTabTypes` exists for the same reason -
 * so asking "is the editor plugin here?" the instant a queued file open drains
 * would raise a false alarm on every launch. So: check, wait a bounded while,
 * and only then conclude the plugin is genuinely absent.
