/**

 * for hover-reveal geometry; this names a *bar the user can switch off*, and the two answer to
 * different settings objects. Keeping them separate is what stops a hover strip being laid for an
 * edge that is permanently hidden and has nothing to reveal.

/**
 * Right-click menu shared by the top bar, the bottom bar and both icon strips.
 *
 * Replaces the two placeholder entries the top bar carried since it was written - an "Edit" and a
 * "Save" whose `onClick` bodies were empty comments, so the one menu in this app a user was most
 * likely to find by accident promised two actions that did not exist.
 *
 * The three entries are the three things a user right-clicking chrome plausibly wants: make this
 * bar go away, clear all the chrome at once, or go and configure it. Hiding is the reason the View
 * menu grew a matching set of checkboxes in the same change - a bar that can be hidden from a menu
 * nobody can find again would be worse than no menu at all.
 *
 * No item carries a `trailingIcon`, deliberately: `isNativeRepresentable` refuses the native macOS
 * NSMenu path for any menu that has one, and on the drawn path this menu would be painted *behind*
 * the browser's native surface on Windows. Leading icons are fine and do not disqualify it.
