/**
 * The way into every tool, for windows where the icon strips are not both on screen.
 *
 * The icon is the app-grid, the shape a launcher or a store wears everywhere else - a thing you
 * open to go and pick something. Deliberately not an arrow pointing at the missing strip, which
 * would name a scope this does not have (the dialog lists every tool whichever strip is gone),
 * and deliberately not a puzzle piece: that says "plugin", an implementation detail, where what
 * the user is looking for is a tool. `GlobalSearchDialog` already uses this glyph for the
 * everything-category, so a grid of squares means the same thing in both places.
 *
 * **Raises a callback; it does not own the dialog.** An earlier version kept `showDialog` here,
 * which worked in a strip and failed in the floating cluster: that cluster is a heavyweight
 * always-on-top window, `FocusModeQuickActions` swaps it for an in-place rendering the moment the
 * main window loses focus, and opening a dialog is exactly what takes focus away - so the subtree
 * holding the state was disposed and the dialog vanished about 200ms after opening. The same file
 * already says this in prose about the sign-out dialog: the buttons raise callbacks and
 * `BossAppScaffold` owns the state, because a dialog composed inside a content-sized overlay
 * window has nowhere to go.
 *
 * @param hintDirection which way the tooltip opens - away from the edge the button sits on.
 * @param onClick asks the window to open the tools dialog.
