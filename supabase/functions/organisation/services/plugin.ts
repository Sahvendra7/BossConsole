/**
 * One plugin, for its page.
 *
 * Read through `get_plugin_with_stats_for_viewer`, which the plugin-store migrations already own,
 * rather than selecting from `plugins` here. Two reasons, and the second is the important one:
 * that RPC applies `user_can_view_plugin_row` for the viewer, so an `org` or `unlisted` plugin is
 * invisible to somebody who may not see it; and this function is a SERVICE ROLE caller, so a
 * `.from("plugins").select()` would be an authorization decision written in TypeScript, outside
 * every test the database layer has. Same rule as utils/org-rpc.ts states for the org tables.
