/**
 * GET  /o/:slug/plugins/:pluginId          -- one plugin's page
 * POST /o/:slug/plugins/:pluginId/visibility -- an org admin changing who can see it
 *
 * NESTED UNDER THE OWNING ORGANISATION, which is a deliberate choice with a cost worth writing
 * down: the URL moves if a plugin is re-attributed, and that is not hypothetical - 20260812000000
 * moved five plugins from `boss` to `risa`. Links to the old path stop resolving. What it buys is
 * that ownership is visible in the URL and the org session already in hand is exactly the
 * credential the visibility control needs, with no second handoff.
 *
 * THE PLUGIN IS CHECKED AGAINST THE SLUG IN THE PATH, every time, on both verbs. Without that,
 * `/o/my-org/plugins/<someone else's plugin>` would render - and worse, POST would carry an
 * org-admin session for MY organisation into a write on THEIRS. It is the same rule
 * routes/domains.ts states for domain ids, for the same reason.
