/**
 * Every RPC this function names must exist in the migrations with the parameters we send.
 *
 * THE BLIND SPOT THIS EXISTS TO CLOSE. `createRpcStub` keys its responses on the function NAME and
 * ignores the params entirely, so an RPC called with parameter names the database does not have
 * passes every route test, every time. PostgREST resolves a function by its argument names, so
 * such a call fails to resolve at runtime and the page renders a generic refusal.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: `mark_organisation_domain_verified` was called through `callForActor`,
 * which appends `p_actor_id` to every call. That function takes `p_domain_id` and `p_verified_by`
 * and no `p_actor_id`, so DOMAIN VERIFICATION NEVER COMPLETED - the DNS probe passed and the write
 * that follows it failed, reported as "The change was refused." 159 tests were green throughout.
 *
 * Source-scanned rather than executed, because the failure is in the shape of a call and there is
 * no database here to make it against.
