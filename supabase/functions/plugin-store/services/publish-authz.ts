/**
 * May this caller publish at all, and if so, for whom?
 *
 * TWO WAYS TO BE ALLOWED, and keeping them apart is the whole point of this module:
 *
 *  1. `plugins.create` (or global admin). Unrestricted, the BOSS store included. This is what
 *     `boss_plugin_admin` exists for and what every release API key uses; its behaviour here is
 *     deliberately byte-identical to the `requiredPermission` gate this module replaced.
 *
 *  2. An organisation you may publish for. No global permission at all: the authority is the
 *     organisation's own `publish_policy` / `publish_role_id`, evaluated by
 *     `user_can_publish_org_plugin`. An org admin satisfies the default policy (`admins`), so an
 *     approved organisation can ship plugins the day it is created instead of waiting for a
 *     platform admin to grant `plugins.create`.
 *
 * THE SECOND PATH CAN NEVER REACH THE BOSS STORE, and that is structural rather than a permission
 * check. `@boss` is `is_system`, and `nonSystemOrgIds` - the only list this module authorises
 * against - drops system organisations. So the three ways a publish lands on `@boss` all refuse:
 * naming it explicitly, naming nothing (the `plugins_default_org` trigger resolves null to boss),
 * and a plugin whose recorded `org_id` is boss.
 *
 * Refusals name the reason. "You have no organisation", "your organisation's policy refuses you"
 * and "that is the BOSS store" send the reader to three different places, and collapsing them into
 * one "permission denied" is what made the previous gate unactionable for the people it caught.
