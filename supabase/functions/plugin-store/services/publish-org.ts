/**
 * Which organisation a newly published plugin belongs to.
 *
 * Until now: always the boss organisation. `createPlugin` never set `org_id`, so the
 * `plugins_default_org` BEFORE INSERT trigger resolved `slug = 'boss'` for every row. The
 * organisation was never CHOSEN - not from the request, not from a JWT claim, and not even from
 * the publishing API key's own `org_id`, which `validate_plugin_api_key` returns and this function
 * used to discard. Every plugin in the store is boss-owned as a result, which makes ownership
 * inert: `@boss` is the system organisation every signup joins, so it restricts nothing.
 *
 * THE PUBLISH PATH RUNS AS SERVICE ROLE, so RLS is bypassed - including the
 * `can_publish_org_plugin` WITH CHECK on `plugins`. Nothing else would stop a caller naming an
 * organisation they have no rights in. The gate therefore has to be explicit here, which is what
 * `validate_plugin_api_key`'s own COMMENT already specifies: "The publish path must gate on
 * user_can_publish_org_plugin(user_id, org_id)".
 *
 * `user_can_publish_org_plugin` is that single source of truth - it evaluates `publish_role_id`
 * (which overrides) then `publish_policy`, and short-circuits true for a global admin. It is
 * deliberately not reimplemented in TypeScript.

/**
 * The minimum this needs to know about the caller.
 *
 * Structural rather than `AuthResult`, because two different authentication paths reach here with
 * two different shapes: the publish routes carry an `AuthResult`, and the API-key routes carry
 * `getUserFromToken`'s narrower object. Both satisfy this, and neither has to be widened to a type
 * it does not otherwise use.
 *
 * `apiKeyOrgId` is absent on a browser publish, which is exactly right: there is no key to inherit

/**
 * Decide and authorise the owning organisation for a NEW plugin.
 *
 * Only for creation. A new VERSION of an existing plugin must never re-derive this: ownership is a
 * property of the plugin, and re-resolving on every version would silently move a plugin between
 * organisations as its publisher's memberships changed.
 *
 * Precedence, most explicit first:
 *
 *   1. `requestedOrgId` - the caller said so. Always authorised, never trusted.
 *   2. The API key's bound `org_id`, for a CI publish. Also authorised: the key is not an
 *      independent principal, so a revoked membership must revoke the key's publish rights.
 *   3. The caller's single non-system organisation, when they have exactly one.
 *   4. Null, meaning "let the trigger decide", which is the boss organisation.
 *
 * Step 3 requires EXACTLY ONE for a reason. The original migration rejected deriving from
 * membership as ambiguous, and it is right whenever there is a choice to make: picking the
 * alphabetically-first of three organisations would attribute somebody's plugin to a place they
 * did not intend and give that organisation's admins rights over it. With exactly one candidate
 * there is nothing to guess. Systems organisations are excluded because `@boss` holds every user,
 * so counting it would make the answer "boss" for everybody and defeat the whole step.
