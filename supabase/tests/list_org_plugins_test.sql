-- pgTAP tests for list_org_plugins (20260813000000).
-- Run with: supabase test db
--
-- Two properties, and the second is the one that would be easy to lose in a refactor:
-- enumeration requires membership, and each ROW is still filtered by user_can_view_plugin_row.
-- Being in an organisation is not permission to see everything attached to it - `unlisted` means
-- unlisted to members too - so a listing that filtered only on org_id would show a member more
-- than the store catalogue ever would.
