/**
 * Contains exceptions thrown while *rendering* a plugin's subtree — during
 * measure, placement or draw — and attributes them to [pluginId] by position in
 * the tree rather than by inspecting stack frames.
 *
 * ### Why this exists
 *
 * [PluginCrashInterceptor] attributes a crash by looking for the plugin in the
 * stack: a sandbox thread name, a class whose name starts with the plugin id, or
 * a class loadable from the plugin's classloader. That works for exceptions
 * thrown *during composition*, which is what it was built for — a
 * `NoSuchMethodError` from a binary incompatibility has the plugin's own frames
 * on the stack.
 *
 * It cannot work for the layout phases. By the time Compose measures a subtree,
 * the plugin's composable functions have already run and returned; all they did
 * was emit `LayoutNode`s. Compose walks those nodes later from its own loop, so
 * the stack holds nothing but `androidx.compose.*` frames and nothing anywhere
 * records which plugin owns a node. Attribution returns null, and the window
 * handler in main.kt then treats it as a host crash — which disposes the window
 * and takes the whole app down.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: BossConsole-Releases#16 was a bookmarks-plugin bug
 * (two LazyColumn items under one key, so one `LayoutNode` was measured twice in
 * a pass) that killed BossConsole with
 * `IllegalStateException: layout state is not idle before measure starts`, and
 * the reported stack trace contains not one plugin frame.
 *
 * This boundary sidesteps attribution entirely: whatever is thrown underneath it
 * belongs to the plugin it wraps, because of where it sits.
 *
 * ### What happens on a crash
 *
 * The throw is swallowed for the current frame, the subtree collapses to the
 * minimum size the parent allows, and [onRenderCrash] is invoked. That records
 * the crash, which tears the subtree down and rebuilds it so
 * [PluginErrorBoundary] can render its fallback — the same recovery path a
 * composition crash already takes.
 *
 * Reported once per boundary instance. A failing measure is usually retried
 * several times before the rebuild lands, and one broken panel should not
 * produce a burst of identical crash records.
 *
 * ### What it does not cover
 *
 * Compose can re-measure a dirty node *directly*, using its last constraints,
 * without walking down from its ancestors. When that node is inside the plugin
 * subtree this boundary is not on the stack and cannot intercept. The reported
 * crash did enter through the ancestors, and a size change from such a remeasure
 * propagates upward and re-enters here on the next pass — but the gap is real,
 * which is why the window handler must also stop treating an unattributed render
 * exception as fatal.
 *
 * Same family, equally unattributable, and equally not covered here:
 * `Modifier.onGloballyPositioned` / `onSizeChanged` callbacks, which run after
 * the `layout {}` block has returned and so outside its `try`, and pointer-input
 * and gesture handlers, which run on their own dispatch.
 *
 * ### Layout transparency, and where it stops
 *
 * Constraints are forwarded untouched and a healthy subtree measures exactly as
 * it would without this in the way. Two things an inserted `Layout` cannot make
 * transparent, invisible at the call site:
 *
 * - **Parent data does not cross it.** A `Modifier.weight()` or
 *   `Modifier.align()` applied inside [content] from a captured outer
 *   `RowScope`/`ColumnScope` now sits on a grandchild of the real parent and is
 *   ignored. No current caller does this; the next one might.
 * - **Multiple roots stack.** If [content] emits several siblings they are
 *   placed at the same origin with `Box` semantics, where previously the real
 *   parent would have laid them out.
 *
 * @param pluginId Plugin that owns [content]; used only for logging here.
 * @param onRenderCrash Invoked at most once per boundary, on the UI thread rather
 *   than inline, so it is free to write snapshot state. It should not throw; if
 *   it does, the throw is logged and swallowed rather than allowed to escalate a
 *   contained crash.
 * @param dispatchToUiThread How that hand-off happens. Defaults to the EDT. A
 *   parameter rather than a hardcoded `SwingUtilities.invokeLater` because
 *   `runComposeUiTest` does not pump a real event queue, so a test that waited on
 *   the EDT would simply hang — and a boundary whose recovery path cannot be
 *   tested is not worth much.
