 * The failure being guarded against: a plugin's composables have already
 * returned by the time Compose measures, places or draws their nodes, so an
 * exception there carries no plugin frame and
 * [PluginCrashInterceptor.attributeToPlugin] cannot identify an owner. The
 * window handler then treats it as a host fault and disposes the window, ending
 * the app — which is how a duplicate LazyColumn key in the bookmarks plugin took
 * BossConsole down (BossConsole-Releases#16).
