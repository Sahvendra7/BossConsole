/**
 * Pins the signal the unload path waits on before closing a plugin's classloader.
 *
 * The bug it exists for: closing a plugin's tabs mutates the tab model on the EDT and returns,
 * while Compose disposes the subtree on a LATER render frame - and that frame is what runs the
 * plugin's own `onDispose` lambdas. Unloading in between leaves those lambdas unable to resolve
 * their own classes, which surfaces as a `NoClassDefFoundError` blaming a reference that outlived
 * the unload. Waiting on this registry is what closes that window.
 *
 * The timeout half is as load-bearing as the waiting half: a window that never draws would
 * otherwise hang an unload forever.
