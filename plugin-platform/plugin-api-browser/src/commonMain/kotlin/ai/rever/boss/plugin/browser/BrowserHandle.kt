     * field and the screen did not change. The visible identifier box was missed entirely, because
     * `[autocomplete="username"]` is an exact attribute match and the field declares
     * `autocomplete="username webauthn"`, a space-separated token list. The last-resort strategy
     * was "first text input in a `<form>` containing a password", and that page has no `<form>`.

     * element beats any heuristic, so credential filling belongs on the caller's side of the
     * boundary along with the rules for deciding a field is real. See fluck-browser's
     * `CredentialFill`.
     *
     * **This copy is the one that runs.** `BrowserHandle` is host-compiled and served parent-first,

     * release, and consumers gate on `minBossVersion`.
     *
     * **A no-op body rather than deletion, deliberately.** Removing the declaration would make
     * every caller compiled against an older api throw `NoSuchMethodError` at the call site.
     * fluck-browser 1.2.19 guards its call and would degrade to nothing, but 1.2.18 and earlier
     * call it bare inside a `launch`, where an `Error` reaches the coroutine uncaught and the host
     * tears the whole plugin down - closing every open browser tab. Returning false gives those
     * builds a silent no-op, which is also strictly better than what they do today: writing a

     * **The host injects; the caller decides what to look for.** The host puts a bridge object on
     * `window` under [PAGE_EVENT_BRIDGE], evaluates [script], and forwards whatever string that
     * script hands the bridge. It does not parse the JSON, define an event vocabulary, or know what
     * any event means. That split is the lesson of [fillCredentials] applied to reading instead of
     * writing: a signature that forces the *host* to decide which field matters gets the decision
     * wrong on real pages, because the plugin is the side that knows which box the user acted on.
     *
     * **What this adds that [executeJavaScript] cannot do.** Not access - a plugin can already read
     * any page content by evaluating a script and reading its return value, and this grants nothing
     * beyond that. What is new is *timing*, in two ways a poll has no answer for:
     *
     * - **Document start.** [script] runs before the page's own scripts, so a listener it installs
     *   sees events the page would otherwise consume first.
     * - **A push.** An event can be delivered while the document that produced it is still alive.
     *   A form submit is followed by a navigation that destroys the JS context, so anything latched
     *   in the page for a later read is racing its own teardown.
     *
     * Contract:
     * - [onEvent] is invoked on a **JxBrowser thread** and MUST NOT block. Do nothing beyond a
     *   non-blocking enqueue; the work belongs on the caller's own dispatcher.
     * - An exception thrown by [onEvent] is swallowed rather than propagated, because the thread it
     *   would unwind is the page's.
     * - Main frame only. A form inside a cross-origin iframe is out of reach here, exactly as it is
     *   for [executeJavaScript].
     * - [script] is evaluated once per document, and also injected into the document already loaded
     *   so installation does not wait for the next navigation. Write it to be idempotent.
     * - Calling this again replaces the previous script and callback. Passing `(null, null)`
     *   uninstalls: no further events are delivered, though a script already evaluated in a live
     *   document stays in that document until it navigates.
     * - A handle whose browser is gone does nothing, and never throws.
     *
     * **This copy is the one that runs.** `BrowserHandle` is host-compiled and served parent-first,
