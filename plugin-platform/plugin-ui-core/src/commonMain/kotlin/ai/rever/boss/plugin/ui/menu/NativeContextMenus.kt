 * - **Windows**: unverified and plausibly worse. `WPopupMenuPeer` appears to reach
 *   `::TrackPopupMenu` through `AwtToolkit::SyncCall`, which would block the EDT for as long as
 *   the menu is open, freezing the UI. `TrackPopupMenu` also renders the classic Win32 menu,
 *   which does not follow system dark mode without `uxtheme` work AWT does not do.
 * - **Linux**: the AWT peer is the Motif-era XAWT menu, which ignores GTK.
 *
 * The engine is otherwise platform-neutral. Widening it is this one predicate plus a measurement
 * on that platform with the same harness.

 * - **Separator hygiene.** Leading, trailing and consecutive separators are dropped, and an empty
 *   submenu is removed entirely. A menu assembled with `if` guards routinely produces those, and
 *   a native menu renders a dangling separator as a stray line rather than ignoring it.
 * - **Mnemonic escaping.** On Windows, `AppendMenu`/`SetMenuItemInfo` treat `&` in an `MFT_STRING`
 *   as a mnemonic prefix, so a label like `feat/a&b` would render as `feat/ab` with an underlined
 *   `b`. Labels here are user data (branch names, file names, workspace names), so this is
 *   reachable in ordinary use. Unreachable while the gate is macOS-only, but kept and tested so
 *   widening the gate cannot silently mangle text.
