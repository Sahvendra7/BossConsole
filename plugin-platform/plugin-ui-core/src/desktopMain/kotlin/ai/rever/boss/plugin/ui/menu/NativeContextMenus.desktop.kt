/**
 * `java.awt.PopupMenu`, which on macOS is peered by `sun.lwawt.macosx.CPopupMenu` onto a real
 * `NSMenu` (`CMenu.getNativeMenu()` hands back the `NSMenu*`, and `libawt_lwawt.dylib` carries
 * `popUpMenuPositioningItem:atLocation:inView:`).
 *
 * Four behaviours were **measured** with a throwaway harness rather than read out of the JDK
 * sources, and each one shapes the code below. Do not re-derive them:
 *
 * 1. `show()` does **not** block. It returns in ~0 ms and the EDT stays live, so Compose keeps
 *    painting while the menu is up. It also means its return is not a dismissal signal.
 * 2. **Nothing cancels an open menu.** `setVisible(false)`, `remove()` and `dispose()` on the
 *    invoker all leave it tracking and selectable. So [hide] cannot dismiss; correctness rests on
 *    the generation fence, which makes a lingering menu's items inert.
 * 3. **There is no dismissal event on any AWT mask.** But an open menu holds the input grab and
 *    lets nothing through (dragging the pointer across it, and pressing and releasing a modifier,
 *    both delivered zero events), while dismissal produces an immediate burst: `MOUSE_EXITED`,
 *    the Escape key-release, then `MOUSE_ENTERED`. So "clear on the next input event" cannot fire
 *    early and fires promptly.
 * 4. `MenuShortcut` is **display-only** - no live key equivalent, so glyphs cannot double-fire
 *    with the app's own accelerators. Menu items **can** be disabled while the menu is open, and
 *    a disabled item does not activate; that is what lets [hide] grey an orphan.
 *
 * Fact 3 is specifically an NSMenu-tracking property and is the first thing to re-measure if
 * [shouldUseNativeMenus] ever widens past macOS.
